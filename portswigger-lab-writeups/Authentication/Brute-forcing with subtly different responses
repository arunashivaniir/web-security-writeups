**Lab: Username enumeration via subtly different responses**

This lab was way similar to the previous labs that I worked on, 
The only difference was that I had to add an error message column using "Grep-catch" which display the message:
"Invalid username or password"

After the attack, while noticing the extra error column, we observed for value that had a typo mistake like a period somewher.
and.....There I found one without a period.

Then I used the password list again in intruder as a payload to brute force the passwords which redirected and gave 302 as a response code.

And, this is how i solved this lab!
