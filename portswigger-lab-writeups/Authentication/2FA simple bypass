Lab: 2FA simple bypass 1

This lab's two-factor authentication can be bypassed. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.

Your credentials: wiener:peter
Victim's credentials carlos:montoya

Step 1:
I logged into my credentials 'wiener:peter' 

Step 2:
Once it asked for my 4-digit code I checked my client email inbox.
->In that it had sent me a 4-digit coode which i used to log in.

But when i did the same for the victim's account ,i received no mail.
Then I logged into my account like earlier and noticed the URL,it was kinda funny

"https://0a57009504abe02e80fbf8f50000004c.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=wiener"
Did you see that!!

So finally I changed the id from wiener->carlos 
AND it worked!!
