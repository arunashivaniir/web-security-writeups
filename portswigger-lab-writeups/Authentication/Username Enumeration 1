Lab: Username enumeration via different responses
This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

Candidate usernames
Candidate passwords
To solve the lab,I have to enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

To solve this lab,
Step 1:
Use burp suite proxy to receive and send requests.
->Login using a random username and password to test

Step 2:
Send the POST Login request to intruder
->Highlight the username parameter and click add to add payload.

Step 3:
Click on Payloads and ensure it is simple list
->Under payload configuration paste the username list and click 'start attack'.
->Notice the length of each username, the one which has a greater length than all the other username is the valid username.
->To verify click on its respons and you can see that it says incorrect password while all others say invalid username.

Step 4:
Follow the same for password parameter and now look at the status code received , while all the passwords are '200' the valid password says '302'.

Step 5:
Now use the Valid username and password to login and solve the lab

The credentials I got as valid:-
