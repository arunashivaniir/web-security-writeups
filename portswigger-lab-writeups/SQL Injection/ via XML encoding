Lab: SQL injection with filter bypass via XML encoding
PRACTITIONER

The goal is to bypass the backend to get credentials from the username and passwords table.

We first observe the HTTP history in burp, we notice POST /product/stock, we send it to repeater
In the body we find productid and storeid tags,
In the input field of storeid I passed the union query with one NULL, which returned the number of units and null.

hence, I checked for number of matching columns we turned out to be 1, using query:
1 UNION SELECT NULL
But, this return "attack detected" as a response ,so from the hint we use hackverter extension to add tags to the query(hex_entities)
Now the response is drawn successfully.

Then i replaced NULL with ,
1 UNION SELECT USERNAME || '-' || PASSWORD FROM USERS

Thereby , revealing the username and its password with string concatenation and logged in using those credentials to solve the lab.
