 SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

AIM:
 To perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.        
 
 Method Used:
 Using SQLi commands to manipulate input and access unreleaed products from 'category' parameter.
 
 It uses the logic:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

I  commented the input in the field ‘category’ to show all products without filters and released information is ignored.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access the Lab.
2.click on a category (for e.g.Pets)
3.Intercept the request using burpsuite and change the value of parameter ‘category=Pets’ to ‘category=’+OR+1=1--

This will make the the query:
 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ’+OR+1=1--

This will comment all the filters in the category field and hence display all the products(including unreleased).
